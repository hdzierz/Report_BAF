# Progress Towards Impact  
Provide a brief update on progress towards impact during this reporting period. If relevant, provide a brief note on anything that was not anticipated and which has or is likely to significantly delay the completion of planned milestones (and outputs, outcomes and impacts) â€“ what happened and how have you responded to it.

# Next steps What are the next steps required to maximise impact?  
Outline your plan for the next steps in implementing this work and/or addressing scientific questions that remain. Note any risks and how they they will or could be managed. 

During the course of this program we have developed a set of guidelines and recommendations to improve the success of Plant & Food Research in leveraging data management as an activator of our scientific endeavours. The guidelines exist in the form of best practices and the recommendations are included here.

## Recommendations

    1. Something
    2. Something else

# Outputs for 2015-16 
Standard bibliographic details for publications (peer reviewed or popular), reports, patents or other IP, plus conference presentations, seminars/workshops to science or end user audience, especially where this supports realisation of an impact. Identify any items that are in draft or in press. Must be outputs that contribute directly to the objectives and milestones in your project plan. Note where funding of an output is shared with other projects.
